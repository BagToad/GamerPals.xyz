## General Moderation Policies

This document describes general aspects about the moderation policy undertaken in GamerPals

### Punishment system

Punishments for rule infractions in GamerPals follow a simple five-strike model. Each warning will result in a strike being applied on a member's moderation record. Subsequent strikes will automatically escalate as follows:

1. (No action, warning only)
2. 10 minute mute
3. 2 hour mute
4. 1 day mute
5. Permanent ban

Staff have the right to immediately escalate to more severe punishments or punishments not present in this list, should it be found to be warranted in order to sufficiently shut down and deter misconduct by a member.

Strikes decay at a rate of 1 per every 60 days. In other words, a member with 4 strikes will be back to 0 strikes after roughly 8 months have passed.

### Appealing Punishments

If you believe that a punishment was erroneously issued to you, owing to an operational error by either an automated tool or a moderator, you may appeal by opening a ticket. Any punishments, including warnings, may be appealed.

Appeals of manual moderation actions will be independently reviewed by staff members other than the actioning staff member, in order to ensure a fair appeals process

If you feel like you have been wrongly banned, or you feel that you have bettered yourself after reflecting on the reason for your ban, you may send in an appeal and it will be considered by staff. Ban appeals shall be filed at [https://dyno.gg/form/38efff12/](https://dyno.gg/form/38efff12/)

Appeals by third parties (i.e. someone other than the punished member) will be disregarded. Appeals must come from the receiving party of the punishment.
