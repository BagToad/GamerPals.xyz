Below are the rules of the server. If you are unsure about any or wish to discuss in further detail, contact the moderators.

## 1. Be kind to your fellow pals

Please help us keep this server a friendly, positive and welcoming place for all.

This means:
- No personal attacks, insults, or put-downs.
- No inflammatory or derogatory remarks.
- No passive aggression or backhanded comments meant to hurt or demean.

## 2. No advertising, no recruiting

This includes linking to other discord servers in both the server and direct messages. The members of GamerPals are here to make personal connections, not be coerced to join yet another server.

Do not advertise anything you stand to benefit from. A few examples of this are: other Discord servers, websites, Youtube channels, etc.

When in doubt, STOP, ask moderators before continuing.

## 3. No romantic advances

GamerPals is a **strictly** platonic community.

We recognize we are all adults and feelings happen, but that's not what this is about. Joining GamerPals specifically to find a romantic partner is strictly prohibited.

Violations of this rule include:
- targeting a specific gender, or sexual orientation
- unsolicited sexual or adjacently sexual direct messages

## 4. No NSFW or overly graphic material

We recognize gaming culture has a connection to banter, and some degree of topics not typically "safe for work" will typically arise.

However, excessively sexual language, jokes, or images can get in the way of platonics and friend-making.

Moderators **will** issue warnings for the following behavior:

- graphic/directly sexual images/pornography.
- discussion of sex acts without any meaning aside from being directly sexual.
- lengthy discussion lingering on sexual themes. Moderators reserve the right to move the conversation along.
- flirtatious sexual innuendo directed towards any person including themselves.
- non-consensual sexual commentary towards any person.

Staff will have the final say in what crosses the lines. Not sure? Send it to a staff member in a ticket first.

## 5. Subjects better discussed elsewhere

There are certain topics that can be considered volatile, controversial and divisive where GamerPals, being a friend-making community, is not the correct forum to discuss them in. These subjects may have communities dedicated to them, and they are better discussed in those.

Examples of time-old topics that are covered by this rule include, but are not limited to, matters of:

- Politics
- Religion
- Divisive sub-cultures
- Gender and sexuality education
- Mental health support
- Ongoing global armed conflicts

GamerPals moderators have the right to intervene in and shut down any conversations on these kinds of topics and redirect them to more appropriate fora.

## 6. No hate speech, any type of bullying, or harassment

Absolutely zero tolerance for hate of any kind.

## 7. Don't obstruct moderation

If you see any of our staff members actively moderating a channel, please stay out of their way until the situation has been resolved. Any members interjecting in active cases of moderation are only making the job harder for the GamerPals staff.

These rules try to cover as much as possible but unforeseeable situations could arise and will be up to the staff's discretion.

### Use only English

We're an English server and our staff is primarily English speaking. We cannot moderate what we cannot understand.

### Do not impersonate staff

Don't pretend to be staff; this includes but is not limited to: copying their profile picture, putting a hammer emoji in your name, having the same name as a staff member and pretending to be a member of the staff team.

### Follow the spirit of the rules

This speaks for itself: don't be difficult or generally a pain in the ass by trying to find loop holes in the rules or skirt around them.

### No Minimodding

Minimodding will not be tolerated in the server.

A user is considered minimodding if they try to moderate a conversation without being a staff member. This includes repeatedly pointing out to a user that something is against the rules.

Staff have the final say on moderation matters, i.e "rule lawyering" is not permitted. If you wish to lodge a general complaint about the conduct of the moderation team in a given situation, you may do so via a ticket. You do not need to do someone else's bidding on being treated unfairly in chat, and this will likely be perceived as interference by the moderation team.

If you suspect a member is breaking a rule, do not engage. Avoid piling on the user with your own rules lawyering. Alert one of our staff members through a ticket.

### Do not discuss infractions in public

Use a ticket if you want to discuss an infraction or mute: don't do it anywhere else on the server.
