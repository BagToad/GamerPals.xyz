GamerPals is a Reddit and Discord community founded on Feb 22, 2013.

## Our Mission Statement

We believe that gaming is better with friends. Our mission is to provide a welcoming, inclusive, social space to connect people from across the world.

## Shared Management

The moderation team manages both the [Reddit community](https://reddit.com/r/gamerpals) and the [discord server](https://discord.gg/gamerpals), but this site mainly serves as a portal for the Discord server. The rules for Reddit are separate, and can be found on the community's sidebar.
